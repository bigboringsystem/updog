# Contributing to updog -- the rules

## See if an issue already exists and who is assigned

If an issue already exists and has someone assigned to it, do NOT take it over without asking for their approval.

## Do not send pull requests for new features without starting a conversation about it first

Not every feature will be accepted into the codebase for various design constraints. Please open an issue to start a discussion before doing work on it. Or fork the project and run it on your own server.

## Please try your best to match the JavaScript formatting on the rest of the codebase

If we apply whitespace between certain spots, try to do the same. If we use triple equals, also try to do the same. At worst, we will let you know on your pull request and you can rebase your changes.

## And finally ...

The goal of this project is to maintain simplicity and understand how people can work together on a minimal system. The goal is not to turn it into Facebook number two. Or Ello. Or whatever else.

Other than that, we love contributions so if you're unsure where to start, feel free to ask the community!
